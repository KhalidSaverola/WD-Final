## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The project is the development of a personal website (v.2) aimed at showcasing design skills and proficiency in web development. This website serves as an online portfolio, presenting the creator's professional information, past projects, and design capabilities in a visually engaging manner.

The primary purpose of the project is to create a comprehensive online presence that effectively represents the creator's skills, experiences, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It aims to impress visitors with both the aesthetic appeal of its design and the functional depth of its content.

Minimum 5 Pages: The website will include essential sections such as Home, About Me (resume-like information), Projects Showcase, Design Showcase, and Contact.

Resume-like Information: Detailed information about skills, experience, education, and certifications presented in a structured format.

Project Showcase: A dedicated page featuring past projects with descriptions, images, links to live demos, and GitHub repositories for further exploration.

Design Layouts: Each page will feature unique and visually appealing design layouts, demonstrating proficiency in HTML and CSS. This includes responsive design principles to ensure usability across devices.

Engaging Overview: An introductory page explaining the purpose and guiding visitors through the content of the website.

Technology Stack: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are utilized for building the website.

HTML: Used for structuring the content of each webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

CSS: Employed extensively for styling the website, ensuring consistency in visual design, layout, typography, and color schemes across all pages. CSS is crucial for creating visually appealing interfaces and responsive design elements.

JavaScript: Applied for interactive elements such as navigation menus, image sliders, form validations, and any dynamic content updates. JavaScript enhances user experience by adding functionality beyond static web pages.

File Structure: Organized logically to maintain clarity and facilitate easy maintenance and updates. Files are structured into directories for images, stylesheets (CSS), scripts (JavaScript), and individual HTML pages for each section of the website.

By leveraging these technologies effectively, the project aims to deliver a seamless browsing experience that not only showcases technical skills but also highlights creativity and attention to detail in design. The emphasis on responsive design ensures accessibility across various devices, while performance optimization techniques contribute to fast loading times and smooth user interactions.

### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
- Multipage Structure: The website consists of multiple interconnected pages, each serving a specific purpose:
- Parallax Transition: Implement parallax scrolling effects where background images move at a different speed than the foreground content as the user scrolls. This creates a sense of depth and enhances the visual appeal of the website.
- Transactional Capabilities: Integrate transactional elements such as:

Contact Form: Allows visitors to send messages directly through the website.

Portfolio Links: Links to external repositories or live demos of showcased projects for further exploration.

Interactive Design Elements: JavaScript-powered interactions like sliders, modals, or animated transitions to engage users.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
